    Fanart  for  the  Australian  band  5  Seconds  Of  Summer.  I  worked  with  a  technique  in  which  I  use  lines  to  make  the  shapes  in  the  faces.  These  lines  are  the  borders  for  the  colours.  One  of  these  is  actually  reposted  on  the  Instagram  story  of  5 Seconds  Of  Summer  themselves.
